You must have GDAL library installed (http://gdal.osgeo.org)
as well as it's Perl bindings to make ozitools work.
Also libtiff and zlib are required.

Just issue a command in Fedora-like distros before building
the package:

yum install libtiff-devel zlib-devel gdal-perl

Everything should build with the customary:

./configure
make
make install

Remember that "./configure --help" will show all the options available
to help cope with odd setups, installations, and paths.
